## 👋 Hi, I’m Karol

I’m a **Machine Learning Engineer and Researcher** specializing in **3D radiological image analysis**, with a strong focus on **medical image segmentation, interactive AI, and practical tooling for large-scale medical data**.

I work at the **Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ)** in Heidelberg, Germany, where my work sits at the intersection of **methodological research** and **robust, reusable software** for real-world clinical and research workflows.

## 🔬 Research & Technical Focus

My work primarily revolves around:

* **3D medical image segmentation** (fully supervised, weakly supervised, and interactive)
* **Radiological imaging modalities** (CT, MRI, CBCT, ultrasound)
* **Human-in-the-loop & prompt-based segmentation** for clinical usability
* **Scalable data handling** for large volumetric datasets
* **Benchmarking & evaluation** beyond single-dataset performance

I am particularly interested in **how users interact with models**, how **annotations are generated**, and how **training paradigms generalize across datasets, organs, and institutions**.

## 🧠 Selected Open-Source Work

A few highlights from my GitHub projects and contributions:

* **ScribbleBench** – A large-scale benchmark for **scribble-supervised 3D medical segmentation**, designed to evaluate generalization across datasets and anatomies rather than single-task performance.
* **napari-sam / napari-stream** – Interactive segmentation and real-time model integration in **Napari**, focusing on usability, responsiveness, and clinician-friendly workflows.
* **patchly** – Efficient patch-based processing for **very large images and volumes**, enabling scalable inference and training without sacrificing spatial context.
* **ParticleSeg3D** – Instance-aware 3D segmentation using particle-based representations.
* **M3D-CAM** – Model interpretability and class activation mapping for 3D CNNs.
* **MedVol** – A lightweight abstraction for medical image volumes with metadata-aware IO and manipulation.
* **med-blosc2** – Fast, compressed storage for large medical arrays using Blosc2.
* **confly / tqdmp / human-readable-id** – Small, focused utilities that improve experiment configuration, multiprocessing progress tracking, and reproducibility.

I also work extensively with **nnU-Net** on a daily basis—both as a user and as a reference point for designing strong, generalizable baselines in medical image segmentation.
