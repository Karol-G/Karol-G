## 👋 Hi, I’m Karol

I’m a **Machine Learning Engineer and Researcher** at the Medical Image Computing group of the **Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ)** in Heidelberg, Germany, specializing in **3D radiological image analysis**. Over the last two years, my work has strongly focused on **large-scale self-supervised representation learning** for medical imaging, alongside interactive and applied segmentation research. My work can be broadly grouped into the following areas:

* 🧠 **Large-Scale Self-Supervised Representation Learning (DINOv2 / DINOv3)**:
  My main research focus over the past two years has been on DINO-based foundation models for medical imaging. Within the Human Radiome Project, I worked extensively with DINOv2, contributing to **large-scale pretraining on more than 2.5 million 3D CT and MRI volumes**. I currently work with DINOv3, focusing on parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategies across medical and non-medical image domains. Both research directions are ongoing, with publications expected throughout 2026.

* 🔧 **Methodological & Interactive Deep Learning**:
  Development of 3D medical image segmentation methods, with an emphasis on weak supervision, interactive and prompt-based segmentation, and usability-driven model design. This includes large-scale benchmarking, Napari-based interactive systems, and scalable training and inference pipelines.

* 🧠 **Applied & Clinical Projects**:
  Collaboration with clinical partners on applied radiological segmentation tasks, translating methodological advances into clinically meaningful and validated systems.

* 🛠️ **Tooling & Infrastructure**:
  Design and maintenance of open-source tools for patch-based processing, large-volume data handling, compressed storage, experiment configuration, and reproducible research workflows.

I am a daily user, contributor, and maintainer of **nnU-Net**, and many of my projects build upon its philosophy of strong, generalizable baselines extended toward interactive and foundation-model–based systems.

If you’re interested in **foundation models for medical imaging, 3D segmentation, or robust ML tooling**, feel free to explore my repositories or reach out—I’m always happy to discuss ideas and collaborate on new projects.
